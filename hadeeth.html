                Narrated from 'Aa'ishah that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The likeness of the one who reads Qur'aan and memorizes it is that he is with the righteous honourable scribes.

One good deed is equal to ten good deeds the like of it. I do not say that Alif-Lam-Mim is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Laam is a letter and Meem is a letter.’”

                Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, "Every Prophet was given miracles because of which people believed, but what I have been given, is Divine Inspiration which Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will outnumber the followers of the other Prophets on the Day of Resurrection."
