      <p>This website's content is taken from the Book <span >MA'ARIF-UL-QURAAN</span></p>
      <p>Ma'ariful Qur'an (Urdu: معارف القرآن) is an eight-volume tafsir (exegesis) of the Quran written by Islamic scholar Mufti Muhammad Shafi (1897 -1976). Originally written in Urdu, it is the most prominent work of its author. </p>
      <p>
        The work consists of eight volumes. A detailed introduction, included at the beginning of the first volume, focuses on some of the basic issues of the Quran. Notable among them are the wahy, the modes of descent, the chronology of the revelation of the Quran, the first revealed verses (ayah), Meccan and Medinan verses, the preservation of the Quran, the printing of the Quran, the sources of tafsir, Arabic language etc. The work adopts a simple narrative style: first, several verses are provided in the original Arabic with their literal translation in Urdu; it is then followed by subject-wise discussion on almost every important issue. This narrative technique is repeated until the end. Below is the list of volumes and their contents:<br>

        The first volume: Sura Al-Fatiha and sura Al-Baqara<br>

        The second volume: from sura Al-Imran to sura An-Nisa<br>

        The third volume: from sura Al-Ma'ida to sura Al-A'raf<br>

        The fourth volume: from sura Al-Anfal to sura Hud<br>

        The fifth volume: from sura Yusuf to sura Al-Kahf<br>

        The sixth volume: from sura Maryam to sura Ar-Rum<br>

        The seventh volume:from sura Luqman to sura Al-Ahqaf<br>

        The eighth volume:from sura Muhammad to Surat al-Nas.
